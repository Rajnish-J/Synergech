Here is a more detailed explanation of the JPA annotations that help in developing a project with one and two tables for CRUD operations:

### 1. **Entity Mapping Annotations (Single Table)**

#### 1.1 **`@Entity`**:
- **Purpose**: Marks a class as a persistent entity, meaning it will map to a database table.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Entity
  public class Employee {
      @Id
      @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
      private Long id;
      private String name;
  }
  ```
  In this case, the `Employee` class represents a table in the database. Each instance of this class corresponds to a row in the table.

#### 1.2 **`@Table`**:
- **Purpose**: Specifies the name of the database table that the entity is mapped to.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Entity
  @Table(name = "employee_details")
  public class Employee {
      @Id
      @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
      private Long id;
      private String name;
  }
  ```
  The entity `Employee` is mapped to a table called `employee_details` instead of the default table name (`Employee`).

#### 1.3 **`@Id`**:
- **Purpose**: Specifies the primary key of an entity.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Id
  private Long id;
  ```
  This marks the `id` field as the primary key for the `Employee` entity.

#### 1.4 **`@GeneratedValue`**:
- **Purpose**: Specifies how the primary key should be generated.
- **Strategies**:
  - `IDENTITY`: The database generates the primary key for the entity.
  - `SEQUENCE`: Uses a database sequence to generate the primary key.
  - `AUTO`: The persistence provider (e.g., Hibernate) will automatically select a generation strategy.
  ```java
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private Long id;
  ```

#### 1.5 **`@Column`**:
- **Purpose**: Maps a class field to a specific database column. You can use this to specify column names, data types, constraints, etc.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Column(name = "employee_name", nullable = false)
  private String name;
  ```
  This maps the `name` field to the column `employee_name` in the database.

#### 1.6 **`@Transient`**:
- **Purpose**: Marks a field that should not be persisted to the database. It is useful for fields used only in the business logic and not meant to be saved.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Transient
  private int age; // This field won't be stored in the database
  ```

#### 1.7 **`@Lob`**:
- **Purpose**: Used for fields that will store large objects like long text or binary data (e.g., images, documents).
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Lob
  private String description; // Can store large text data
  ```

#### 1.8 **`@Temporal`**:
- **Purpose**: Used to map `java.util.Date` or `java.util.Calendar` fields to database date, time, or timestamp fields.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Temporal(TemporalType.DATE)
  private Date birthDate; // Maps to a DATE type in the database
  ```

### 2. **Entity Mapping Annotations (Two Tables with Relationships)**

#### 2.1 **`@OneToOne`**:
- **Purpose**: Defines a one-to-one relationship between two entities. This means that one instance of an entity is related to exactly one instance of another entity.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @OneToOne
  @JoinColumn(name = "address_id") // This specifies the foreign key column
  private Address address;
  ```
  This maps a one-to-one relationship between `Employee` and `Address`. The foreign key `address_id` is used to link the two tables.

#### 2.2 **`@OneToMany`**:
- **Purpose**: Defines a one-to-many relationship. This means that one instance of an entity is related to many instances of another entity.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @OneToMany(mappedBy = "employee")
  private List<Project> projects;
  ```
  This means that an `Employee` can have many `Project` objects.

#### 2.3 **`@ManyToOne`**:
- **Purpose**: Defines a many-to-one relationship, meaning that many instances of one entity are associated with a single instance of another entity.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @ManyToOne
  @JoinColumn(name = "department_id") // foreign key column
  private Department department;
  ```
  This means that many `Employee` objects are related to one `Department`.

#### 2.4 **`@ManyToMany`**:
- **Purpose**: Defines a many-to-many relationship, meaning that many instances of one entity are related to many instances of another entity. A join table is used to manage the relationship.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @ManyToMany
  @JoinTable(
      name = "employee_project",
      joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "employee_id"),
      inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "project_id")
  )
  private Set<Project> projects;
  ```
  This means that many `Employee` objects can be related to many `Project` objects, with the `employee_project` table serving as the join table.

#### 2.5 **`@JoinColumn`**:
- **Purpose**: Specifies the foreign key column for the relationship.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @ManyToOne
  @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
  private Department department;
  ```

#### 2.6 **`@JoinTable`**:
- **Purpose**: Used in a many-to-many relationship to define the join table and its columns.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @ManyToMany
  @JoinTable(
      name = "employee_project",
      joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "employee_id"),
      inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "project_id")
  )
  private Set<Project> projects;
  ```

### 3. **Additional Annotations for CRUD Operations**

#### 3.1 **`@Embeddable`**:
- **Purpose**: Marks a class as embeddable, meaning its fields are part of the entity owning it. Often used for composite keys or embedded objects.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Embeddable
  public class Address {
      private String street;
      private String city;
  }
  ```

#### 3.2 **`@Embedded`**:
- **Purpose**: Used to embed the fields of an embeddable class into an entity.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Entity
  public class Employee {
      @Embedded
      private Address address;
  }
  ```

#### 3.3 **`@EmbeddedId`**:
- **Purpose**: Used to map a composite primary key, where the key consists of multiple fields.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Entity
  public class Employee {
      @EmbeddedId
      private EmployeeId employeeId; // composite key
  }
  ```

#### 3.4 **`@AttributeOverrides` & `@AttributeOverride`**:
- **Purpose**: Used to override the mapping of an attribute in an embedded object.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Embedded
  @AttributeOverrides({
      @AttributeOverride(name = "street", column = @Column(name = "home_street")),
      @AttributeOverride(name = "city", column = @Column(name = "home_city"))
  })
  private Address homeAddress;
  ```

### 4. **Annotations for Querying and Transactions**

#### 4.1 **`@Query`**:
- **Purpose**: Used to define custom JPQL or native SQL queries in repository methods.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Query("SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.name = :name")
  List<Employee> findByName(@Param("name") String name);
  ```

#### 4.2 **`@Modifying`**:
- **Purpose**: Indicates that a query is modifying the data (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Modifying
  @Query("UPDATE Employee e SET e.salary = :salary WHERE e.id = :id")
  void updateSalary(@Param("id") Long id, @Param("salary") Double salary);
  ```

#### 4.3 **`@Transactional`**:
- **Purpose**: Used to declare a method or class as transactional.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Transactional
  public void updateEmployee(Employee employee) {
      // Business logic
  }
  ```

### Summary
- **Single Table Operations**: Use `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`, `@Column`, etc.
- **Two Tables with Relationships**: Use `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@ManyToMany`, `@JoinColumn`, `@JoinTable`.
- **Composite Keys and Embedded Objects**: Use `@

Embeddable`, `@Embedded`, `@EmbeddedId`.
- **Query and Transaction Management**: Use `@Query`, `@Modifying`, `@Transactional`. 

These annotations allow you to effectively manage CRUD operations, table relationships, and complex database mappings.
